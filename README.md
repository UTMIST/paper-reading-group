# UTMIST Paper Reading Group 2021-2022
Welcome to UTMIST's paper reading group repo :) This group is a guided discussion group on awesome machine learning research papers. We meet monthly to review a paper that we choose together. Overall, there is a lot of flexibility, and suggestions are more than welcome. The purpose of the reading group is to gently introduce undergraduates to the beauty of theory, expose people to the very frontier of research, and answer questions such as "but why? why the schmidhuber does this work?". If you are interested, [register here](https://forms.gle/ZewiGgxbgtw8xEuh6) to receive email notifications!  

In this repository, you will find slidedecks and paper reproductions (depending on my laziness).

## Timeline
Basically, papers are chosen at the start of each month, and meetings happen on the **last Saturday of each month**.
